Video Classification Log
Week 1:
Research ways to do video classification
-LSTM
-Sport1M
-YouTube8M

problem: unable to train in single image, bc all images too similar, unlike Sport1M/Youtube8M
Problem: prev data in single image, need to be in sequence

Week 2:
Preprocessing Data
bin all data

problem: how to attach CNN and RNN?		Answer: time distributed

Week 3:
Set up model
CNN-→LSTM+DNN (multi in single out)

Variation 1: full inception V3 with partial trainable
Variation 2: partial inception V3 not at all trainable
Variation 3: untrainable inception modules
Variation 4: trainable inception modules

Problem: Val Loss too high, 3x training loss		Answer revise model to multi in multi out

Week 4:
Revise model
CNN-→ LSTM-→ time distributed DNN

Problem: data too unbalance
Solution: delete tiny data set : CLAP	    Incision    Intubation-stylete    medication    Place cuff
Stratify data by number of clips, and apply augmentation through frame manipulations

Week 5

Recreate Resize Data set
Center subjects and re-adjust aspect ratio
& retrain

Week 6

Re-create all data from scratch
