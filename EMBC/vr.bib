		  through immersive virtual environments that are
		  considerably larger than the available real world walking
		  space. However, the most effective strategy for steering
		  the user remains an open question, as most previously
		  presented algorithms simply redirect toward the center of
		  the physical space. In this work, we present a theoretical
		  framework that plans a walking path through a virtual
		  environment and calculates the parameters for combining
		  translation, rotation, and curvature gains such that the
		  user can traverse a series of defined waypoints efficiently
		  based on a utility function. This function minimizes the
		  number of overt reorientations to avoid introducing
		  potential breaks in presence. A notable advantage of this
		  approach is that it leverages knowledge of the layout of
		  both the physical and virtual environments to enhance the
		  steering strategy.},

  abstract	= {An illusory sensation of ownership over a surrogate limb
		  or whole body can be induced through specific forms of
		  multisensory stimulation, such as synchronous visuotactile
		  tapping on the hidden real and visible rubber hand in the
		  rubber hand illusion. Such methods have been used to induce
		  ownership over a manikin and a virtual body that substitute
		  the real body, as seen from first-person perspective,
		  through a head-mounted display. However, the perceptual and
		  behavioral consequences of such transformed body ownership
		  have hardly been explored. In Exp. 1, immersive virtual
		  reality was used to embody 30 adults as a 4-y-old child
		  (condition C), and as an adult body scaled to the same
		  height as the child (condition A), experienced from the
		  first-person perspective, and with virtual and real body
		  movements synchronized. The result was a strong
		  body-ownership illusion equally for C and A. Moreover there
		  was an overestimation of the sizes of objects compared with
		  a nonembodied baseline, which was significantly greater for
		  C compared with A. An implicit association test showed that
		  C resulted in significantly faster reaction times for the
		  classification of self with child-like compared with
		  adult-like attributes. Exp. 2 with an additional 16
		  participants extinguished the ownership illusion by using
		  visuomotor asynchrony, with all else equal. The
		  size-estimation and implicit association test differences
		  between C and A were also extinguished. We conclude that
		  there are perceptual and probably behavioral correlates of
		  body-ownership illusions that occur as a function of the
		  type of body in which embodiment occurs.},

		  Larger changes were accomplished by inverting both spatial
		  axes (which is equivalent to a 180 deg rotation), and then
		  gradually changing response direction ``backwards'' to the
		  prescribed value. The angle of 0 deg had no such limiting
		  value like 90 deg: Response direction could continuously

		  evidence that adaptation to opposite-directed visual
		  rotations results in interference, due to competition in
		  working memory; instead subjects' performance under such
		  conditions is fully explained by the said continuous
		  changes of response direction. We conclude that adaptation

		  Although the latest advancements in VR locomotion have
		  raised the interest of both researchers and users in
		  analyzing and experiencing current VR locomotion
		  techniques, the field of research on VR locomotion, in its
		  new era, is still uncharted. In this work, VR locomotion is
		  explored through a systematic literature review
		  investigating empirical studies of VR locomotion techniques
		  from 2014‚Äì2017. The review analyzes the VR locomotion
		  techniques that have been studied, their
		  interaction-related characteristics and the research topics
		  that were addressed in these studies. Thirty-six articles
		  were identified as relevant to the literature review, and
		  the analysis of the articles resulted in 73 instances of 11
		  VR locomotion techniques, such as real-walking,
		  walking-in-place, point and teleport, joystick-based
		  locomotion, and more. Results showed that since the VR
		  revival, the focus of VR locomotion research has been on VR
		  technology and various technological aspects, overshadowing
		  the investigation of user experience. From an interaction
		  perspective, the majority of the utilized and studied VR
		  locomotion techniques were found to be based on physical
		  interaction, exploiting physical motion cues for navigation
		  in VR environments. A significant contribution of the
		  literature review lies in the proposed typology for VR
		  locomotion, introducing four distinct VR locomotion types:
		  motion-based, room scale-based, controller-based and
		  teleportation-based locomotion.},

		  the assembly of colored physical parts and natural wood
		  colored physical pieces. Spatial ability as measured using
		  a mental rotation test, was shown to correlate with the
		  number of assemblies they were able to complete in the
		  training. While physical training outperformed virtual

  abstract	= {Background: In hemispatial neglect, space can be
		  dissociated on the basis of “near” peripersonal vs
		  “far” extrapersonal space. The clinical manifestations
		  of neglect can be modified by having patients use a tool to
		  explore “far” extrapersonal space. An explanation for
		  this is that the use of a stick produced an extension of
		  body space resulting in a remapping of “far” space as
		  “near” space.Objectives: To determine whether the
		  remapping of space can be generalized to the amelioration
		  of the “affected” vs the “nonaffected” space,
		  rather than being confined to the selective amelioration of
		  “far” vs “near” neglect; and to determine whether
		  tool use is a necessary condition for the remapping of
		  space.Methods: Using virtual reality, the authors asked six
		  hemispatial neglect patients to reach and grasp a real
		  object while simultaneously observing the grasping of a
		  virtual object located within a virtual environment by a
		  virtual hand. The virtual hand was commanded in real time
		  by their real hand.Results: After a period of adaptation,
		  hemispatial neglect patients coded the visual stimuli
		  within the neglected space in an identical fashion as those
		  presented within the preserved portions of
		  space.Conclusions: It is possible to re-create links
		  between the affected and the nonaffected space. Wielding a
		  tool is not a necessary condition in reopening neglected
		  space.},

		  understandings of `affordance'. In contrast, Gibsonian
		  understandings are shown to treat animal-environment
		  systems as unified complex systems and to be compatible
		  with direct perception. We discuss the fruitful connections
		  between Gibsonian affordances and dynamical systems
		  explanation in the behavioral sciences and point to prior

		  We conclude that it is unnecessary to re-imagine
		  affordances as representations in order to make them useful

		  occurred in the way the users performed the task, depending

		  motor behavior. The final aim of this study was to develop
		  a reliable basketball free-throw training system in VEs, so

		  immersive quality elicit higher levels of presence, in turn
		  enhancing the effectiveness of a mediated experience. To
		  investigate this assumption the current meta-analysis
		  synthesizes decades of empirical research examining the
		  effect of immersive system technology on user experiences
		  of presence. Aggregating 115 effect sizes from 83 studies,
		  it finds that technological immersion has a medium-sized
		  effect on presence. Additionally, results show that
		  increased levels of user-tracking, the use of stereoscopic
		  visuals, and wider fields of view of visual displays are
		  significantly more impactful than improvements to most
		  other immersive system features, including quality of
		  visual and auditory content. These findings are discussed
		  in light of theoretical accounts of the presence construct
		  as well as practical implications for design. }

		  Although attentional tracking is known to be highly

		  neurophysiological mechanisms that underlie this capacity
		  limitation have not been established. Here, we provide
		  electrophysiological measures in humans of the initial

		  attentional tracking. Each measure was modulated by the
		  number of objects the subject was tracking and was highly
		  sensitive to each individual's specific tracking capacity.
		  Consequently, these measures provide strong
		  neurophysiological predictors of an individual's
		  attentional tracking capacity. Moreover, by manipulating
		  the difficulty of these two phases of the task, we observe
		  that the limiting factor underlying tracking capacity can
		  flexibly shift between these two attentional mechanisms
		  depending on the requirements of the task.},

		  negativity related to the process of monitoring target
		  position during tracking. This signal was absent for
		  periods of time during tracking tasks when objects briefly
		  stopped moving. These results provide evidence that, during
		  attentive tracking, the process of tracking target
		  locations elicits an electrophysiological response that is
		  distinct and dissociable from neural measures of the number

		  situation awareness, and mental models and goal-directed
		  behavior are hypothesized as important mechanisms for
		  overcoming these limits. The impact of design features,

		  operator situation awareness is addressed, and a taxonomy

		  of embodying these representations remains understudied.
		  The Proteus effect proposed by Yee and Bailenson (2007)
		  suggests that embodiment may lead to shifts in
		  self-perception both online and offline based on the
		  avatar’s features or behaviors. A 2&#xa0;×&#xa0;2
		  experiment, the first of its kind, examined how
		  self-perception and attitudes changed after women
		  (N&#xa0;=&#xa0;86) entered a fully immersive virtual
		  environment and embodied sexualized or nonsexualized
		  avatars which featured either the participant’s face or
		  the face of an unknown other. Findings supported the
		  Proteus effect. Participants who wore sexualized avatars
		  internalized the avatar’s appearance and
		  self-objectified, reporting more body-related thoughts than
		  those wearing nonsexualized avatars. Participants who saw
		  their own faces, particularly on sexualized avatars,
		  expressed more rape myth acceptance than those in other
		  conditions. Implications for both online and offline
		  consequences of using sexualized avatars are discussed. "

		  virtual reality, mid-air ground navigation is becoming a
		  fundamental interaction for a large collection of
		  application scenarios. While classical input devices (e.g.,
		  mouse/keyboard, gamepad, touchscreen) have their own ground
		  navigation standards, natural input techniques still lack
		  acknowledged mechanisms for travelling in a 3D scene. In
		  particular, for most applications, navigation is not the
		  primary interaction. Thus, the user should navigate in the
		  scene while still being able to perform other interactions
		  with her hands, and observe the displayed content by moving
		  her eyes and locally rotating her head. Since most ground
		  navigation scenarios require only two degrees of freedom to
		  move forward or backward and rotate the view to the left or
		  to the right, we propose LazyNav a mid-air ground
		  navigation control model which lets the users hands, eyes
		  or local head orientation completely free, making use of a
		  single pair of the remaining tracked body elements to
		  tailor the navigation. To this end, we design several
		  navigation body motions and study their desired properties,
		  such as being easy to discover, easy to control, socially
		  acceptable, accurate and not tiring. We also develop
		  several assumptions about motions design for ground
		  navigation and evaluate them. Finally, we highlight general
		  advices on mid-air ground navigation techniques.},

		  three-dimensional (3D) mental rotation for 4- to 8-year-old
		  children (N = 165) that uses tangible 3D objects.
		  Results revealed that the measure was both valid and
		  reliable and indicated steady growth in 3D mental rotation
		  between the ages of 4 and 8. Performance on the measure was
		  highly related to success on a measure of two-dimensional
		  (2D) mental rotation, even after controlling for executive
		  functioning. Although children as young as 5 years old
		  performed above chance, 3D mental rotation appears to be a
		  difficult skill for most children under the age of 7, as
		  indicated by frequent guessing and difficulty with mirror
		  objects. The test is a useful new tool for studying the
		  development of 3D mental rotation in young children.}

  abstract	= {<p>The objective of this study was to assess the cognitive
		  effect of human character models on the observer's ability
		  to extract relevant information from computer graphics
		  animation of tennis serve motions. Three digital human
		  models (polygon, shadow, and stick-figure) were used to
		  display the computationally simulated serve motions, which
		  were perturbed at the racket-arm by modulating the speed
		  (slower or faster) of one of the joint rotations (wrist,
		  elbow, or shoulder). Twenty-one experienced tennis players
		  and 21 novices made discrimination responses about the
		  modulated joint and also specified the perceived swing
		  speeds on a visual analogue scale. The result showed that
		  the discrimination accuracies of the experienced players
		  were both above and below chance level depending on the
		  modulated joint whereas those of the novices mostly
		  remained at chance or guessing levels. As far as the
		  experienced players were concerned, the polygon model
		  decreased the discrimination accuracy as compared with the
		  stick-figure model. This suggests that the complicated
		  pictorial information may have a distracting effect on the
		  recognition of the observed action. On the other hand, the
		  perceived swing speed of the perturbed motion relative to
		  the control was lower for the stick-figure model than for
		  the polygon model regardless of the skill level. This
		  result suggests that the simplified visual information can
		  bias the perception of the motion speed toward slower. It
		  was also shown that the increasing the joint rotation speed
		  increased the perceived swing speed, although the resulting
		  racket velocity had little correlation with this speed
		  sensation. Collectively, observer's recognition of the
		  motion pattern and perception of the motion speed can be
		  affected by the pictorial information of the human model as
		  well as by the perturbation processing applied to the
		  observed motion.</p>},

		  faster \{RTs\} for fourth graders compared to second

		  multimedia to instruct in the content of physics. The study
		  assessed which variables predicted learning gains after a
		  1-h lesson on the electric field. The three manipulated
		  variables were: (1) level of embodiment; (2) level of
		  active generativity; and (3) presence of story narrative.
		  Two types of tests were administered: (1) a traditional
		  text-based physics test answered with a keyboard; and (2) a
		  more embodied, transfer test using the Wacom large tablet
		  where learners could use gestures (long swipes) to create
		  vectors and answers. The 166 participants were randomly
		  assigned to four conditions: (1) symbols and text; (2) low
		  embodied; (3) high embodied/active; or (4) high
		  embodied/active with narrative. The last two conditions
		  were active because the on-screen content could be
		  manipulated with gross body gestures gathered via the
		  Kinect sensor. Results demonstrated that the three groups
		  that included embodiment learned significantly more than
		  the symbols and text group on the traditional keyboard
		  post-test. When knowledge was assessed with the Wacom
		  tablet format that facilitated gestures, the two active
		  gesture-based groups scored significantly higher. In
		  addition, engagement scores were significantly higher for
		  the two active embodied groups. The Wacom results suggest
		  test sensitivity issues; the more embodied test revealed
		  greater gains in learning for the more embodied conditions.
		  We recommend that as more embodied learning comes to the
		  fore, more sensitive tests that incorporate gesture be used
		  to accurately assess learning. The predicted differences in
		  engagement and learning for the condition with the
		  graphically rich story narrative were not supported. We
		  hypothesize that a narrative effect for motivation and
		  learning may be difficult to uncover in a lab experiment
		  where participants are primarily motivated by course
		  credit. Several design principles for mediated and embodied
		  science education are proposed.",

  abstract	= {To be truly useful for media theory, the concept of
		  presence should be applicable to all forms of virtual
		  environments including those of traditional media like
		  television and traditional content such as advertising.
		  This study reports the results of an experiment on the
		  effects of the visual angle of the display (sensory
		  saturation) and room illumination (sensory suppression) on
		  the sensation of telepresence during normal television
		  viewing. A self-report measure of presence yielded two
		  factors. Using [Gerrig's (1993)] terminology for the sense
		  of being transported to a mediated environments, we labeled
		  the two factors “arrival,” for the feeling of being
		  there in the virtual environment, and “departure,” for
		  the feeling of not being there in the in physical
		  environment. It appears that being in the virtual
		  environment is not equivalent to not being in the physical
		  environment. A path analysis found that these two factors
		  have very different relationships to viewer memory for the
		  experience and for attitude change (i.e., buying intention
		  and confidence in product decision). We theorize that the
		  departure factor may be measuring the feeling that the
		  medium has disappeared and may constitute a deeper
		  absorption into the virtual environment. The study did not
		  find evidence that visual angle and room illumination
		  affected the sensation of telepresence}

		  These include adaptation, an internal-model based process
		  that reduces sensory-prediction errors in order to return
		  performance to pre-perturbation levels, use-dependent
		  plasticity, and operant reinforcement. Visuomotor rotation
		  and force-field tasks impose systematic errors and thereby
		  emphasize adaptation. In skill learning tasks, which for
		  the most part do not involve a perturbation, improved
		  performance is manifest as reduced motor variability and
		  probably depends less on adaptation and more on
		  success-based exploration. Explicit awareness and
		  declarative memory contribute, to varying degrees, to motor
		  learning. The modularity of motor learning processes maps,
		  at least to some extent, onto distinct brain structures. "

  abstract	= { Abstract Healthy participants are able to move forward
		  within a virtual environment (VE) by the imagination of
		  foot movement. This is achieved by using a brain-computer
		  interface (BCI) that transforms thought-modulated
		  electroencephalogram (EEG) recordings into a control
		  signal. A BCI establishes a communication channel between
		  the human brain and the computer. The basic principle of
		  the Graz-BCI is the detection and classification of
		  motor-imagery-related EEG patterns, whereby the dynamics of
		  sensorimotor rhythms are analyzed. A BCI is a closed-loop
		  system and information is visually fed back to the user
		  about the success or failure of an intended movement
		  imagination. Feedback can be realized in different ways,
		  from a simple moving bar graph to navigation in VEs. The
		  goals of this work are twofold: first, to show the
		  influence of different feedback types on the same task, and
		  second, to demonstrate that it is possible to move through
		  a VE (e.g., a virtual street) without any muscular
		  activity, using only the imagination of foot movement. In
		  the presented work, data from BCI feedback displayed on a
		  conventional monitor are compared with data from BCI
		  feedback in VE experiments with a head-mounted display
		  (HMD) and in a high immersive projection environment
		  (Cave). Results of three participants are reported to
		  demonstrate the proof-of-concept. The data indicate that
		  the type of feedback has an influence on the task
		  performance, but not on the BCI classification accuracy.
		  The participants achieved their best performances viewing
		  feedback in the Cave. Furthermore the VE feedback provided
		  motivation for the subjects. }

		  how spatial memory develops in the investigated age groups.
		  Ten 5-year-old, ten 7-year-old and ten 10-year-old children
		  were presented with the ‘Kiel Locomotor Maze’,
		  containing features of the Radial Arm Maze and the Morris
		  Water Maze, in order to assess spatial memory and
		  orientation. Children had to learn to approach baited
		  locations only. Task difficulty was equated with respect to
		  the children's age. Training was given until the children
		  reached criterion. During testing, the maze configuration
		  and response requirements were systematically altered,
		  including response rotation, cue rotation, cue deletion and
		  response rotation with cue deletion in order to assess the
		  spatial strategies used by the children. During training
		  and testing, working-memory errors (WM), reference-memory
		  errors (RM) and working-reference memory errors (WR) were
		  recorded. As expected, no difference between age groups
		  appeared during training, thus confirming comparable task
		  difficulty across age groups. During testing, age groups
		  differed significantly with regard to the orientation
		  strategy used. The 5-year-olds were bound to a cue
		  strategy, orientating towards local, proximal cues. The
		  10-year-olds mastered all tasks, thus displaying a place
		  strategy, being able to use distal cues for orientation,
		  and were even able to do so after being rotated 180°. The
		  7-year-olds proved to be at an age of transition: five of
		  them were bound to a cue strategy, five children were able
		  to adopt a place strategy. The differences in the
		  orientation strategies used by children of different age
		  groups was reflected by the sum of errors they made, also
		  by RM. WM were found to be rare, especially in older
		  children. We conclude that preschoolers use a cue strategy,
		  that the development of place strategies occurs during
		  primary school age and seems to be complete by the age of
		  10 years.}

		  and its action capabilities are used to scale the spatial
		  layout of the environment. Here we present four studies
		  supporting this perspective by showing that the hand acts
		  as a metric which individuals use to scale the apparent
		  sizes of objects in the environment. However to test this,
		  one must be able to manipulate the size and/or dimensions
		  of the perceiver’s hand which is difficult in the real
		  world due to impliability of hand dimensions. To overcome
		  this limitation, we used virtual reality to manipulate
		  dimensions of participants’ fully-tracked, virtual hands
		  to investigate its influence on the perceived size and
		  shape of virtual objects. In a series of experiments, using
		  several measures, we show that individuals’ estimations
		  of the sizes of virtual objects differ depending on the
		  size of their virtual hand in the direction consistent with
		  the body-based scaling hypothesis. Additionally, we found
		  that these effects were specific to participants’ virtual
		  hands rather than another avatar’s hands or a salient
		  familiar-sized object. While these studies provide support
		  for a body-based approach to the scaling of the spatial
		  layout, they also demonstrate the influence of virtual
		  bodies on perception of virtual environments.</p>},

  abstract	= {Bodily illusions have been used to study bodily
		  self-consciousness and disentangle its various components,
		  among other the sense of ownership and self-location.
		  Congruent multimodal correlations between the real body and
		  a fake humanoid body can in fact trigger the illusion that
		  the fake body is one’s own and/or disrupt the unity
		  between the perceived self-location and the position of the
		  physical body. However, the extent to which changes in
		  self-location entail changes in ownership is still matter
		  of debate. Here we address this problem with the support of
		  immersive virtual reality. Congruent visuotactile
		  stimulation was delivered on healthy participants to
		  trigger full body illusions from different visual
		  perspectives, each resulting in a different degree of
		  overlap between real and virtual body. Changes in ownership
		  and self-location were measured with novel self posture
		  assessment tasks and with an adapted version of the
		  cross-modal congruency task. We found that, despite their
		  strong coupling, self-location and ownership can be
		  selectively altered: self-location was affected when having
		  a third person perspective over the virtual body, while
		  ownership toward the virtual body was experienced only in
		  the conditions with total or partial overlap. Thus, when
		  the virtual body is seen in the far extra-personal space,
		  changes in self-location were not coupled with changes in
		  ownership. If a partial spatial overlap is present,
		  ownership was instead typically experienced with a boosted
		  change in the perceived self-location. We discussed results
		  in the context of the current knowledge of the multisensory
		  integration mechanisms contributing to self-body
		  perception. We argue that changes in the perceived
		  self-location are associated to the dynamical
		  representation of peripersonal space encoded by
		  visuotactile neurons. On the other hand, our results speak
		  in favor of visuo-proprioceptive neuronal populations being
		  a driving trigger in full body ownership illusions.}

		  environments (VEs) in the context of sports. In particular
		  there is a desire to be able to improve sensorimotor skills
		  rather than just using a \{VE\} as a tool for strategy
		  analysis, or entertainment. The range of skills required
		  across all different sports is very large and varied. This
		  review of the state-of-the-art, therefore focuses on just
		  ball sports, and was carried out as part of a current
		  project developing training tools for rugby. A \{VE\} needs
		  to provide realistic rendering of the sports scene to
		  achieve good perceptual fidelity. More important for a
		  sport-themed \{VE\} is high functional fidelity, which
		  requires an accurate physics model of a complex
		  environment, real time response, and a natural user
		  interface. The goal is to provide multiple scenarios to
		  players at different levels of difficulty, providing them
		  with improved skills that can be applied directly to the
		  real sports arena. The typical hardware and software
		  components needed are identified in the paper, and
		  important psychological factors that should be considered
		  are discussed. The challenges that need to be overcome are
		  identified and illustrated with examples from recent
		  projects in this area. "

  abstract	= {Purpose Children in middle childhood are at an increased
		  risk for injury in pedestrian environments. This study
		  examined whether they are capable of showing evasive action
		  (ie, adjusting crossing speed) to avoid injury when
		  crossing streets.Methods The study used a fully immersive
		  virtual reality (VR) system interfaced with a
		  three-dimensional movement measurement system so that the
		  actual crossing behaviour of 7–10-year-old children under
		  different traffic conditions could be precisely measured.
		  Relating outcomes to that which would have been obtained
		  based on using the approach of estimating walking speed and
		  assuming a constant speed provided insights into the
		  realised benefits of the current movement monitoring VR
		  system.Results Controlling for age and sex, children showed
		  evasive action, crossing more quickly as traffic conditions
		  became more risky. Using an average and assuming a constant
		  walking speed underestimated actual walking speed, failing
		  to capture evasive action and leading to overestimation of
		  children being hit compared with the actual incidence of
		  hits.Conclusions VR technology is a valuable tool for
		  assessing child pedestrian behaviour. However, systems need
		  to allow the child to cross the street so their level of
		  pedestrian skill is appropriately measured. The current
		  findings provide the first evidence that children are
		  capable of implementing evasive action in reaction to risky
		  traffic conditions.},

  abstract	= {Mammalian navigation depends both on visual landmarks and
		  on self-generated (e.g., vestibular and proprioceptive)
		  cues that signal the organism's own movement [1-5]. When
		  these conflict, landmarks can either reset estimates of
		  self-motion or be integrated with them [6-9]. We asked how
		  humans combine these information sources and whether
		  children, who use both from a young age [10-12], combine
		  them as adults do. Participants attempted to return an
		  object to its original place in an arena when given either
		  visual landmarks only, nonvisual self-motion information
		  only, or both. Adults, but not 4- to 5-year-olds or 7- to
		  8-year-olds, reduced their response variance when both
		  information sources were available. In an additional
		  "conflict" condition that measured relative reliance on
		  landmarks and self-motion, we predicted behavior under two
		  models: integration (weighted averaging) of the cues and
		  alternation between them. Adults' behavior was predicted by
		  integration, in which the cues were weighted nearly
		  optimally to reduce variance, whereas children's behavior
		  was predicted by alternation. These results suggest that
		  development of individual spatial-representational systems
		  precedes development of the capacity to combine these
		  within a common reference frame. Humans can integrate
		  spatial cues nearly optimally to navigate, but this ability
		  depends on an extended developmental process.},

  abstract	= {Walking-In-Place (WIP) techniques make it possible to
		  facilitate relatively natural locomotion within immersive
		  virtual environments that are larger than the physical
		  interaction space. However, in order to facilitate natural
		  walking experiences one needs to know how to map steps in
		  place to virtual motion. This paper describes two
		  within-subjects studies performed with the intention of
		  establishing the range of perceptually natural walking
		  speeds for WIP locomotion. In both studies, subjects
		  performed a series of virtual walks while exposed to visual
		  gains (optic flow multipliers) ranging from 1.0 to 3.0.
		  Thus, the slowest speed was equal to an estimate of the
		  subjects normal walking speed, while the highest speed was
		  three times greater. The perceived naturalness of the
		  visual speed was assessed using self-reports. The first
		  study compared four different types of movement, namely, no
		  leg movement, walking on a treadmill, and two forms of
		  gestural input for WIP locomotion. The results suggest that
		  WIP locomotion is accompanied by a perceptual distortion of
		  the speed of optic flow. The second study was performed
		  using a 4×2 factorial design and compared four different
		  display field-of-views (FOVs) and two types of movement,
		  walking on a treadmill and WIP locomotion. The results
		  revealed significant main effects of both movement type and
		  field of view, but no significant interaction between the
		  two variables. Particularly, they suggest that the size of
		  the display FOV is inversely proportional to the degree of
		  underestimation of the virtual speeds for both
		  treadmill-mediated virtual walking and WIP locomotion.
		  Combined, the results constitute a first attempt at
		  establishing a set of guidelines specifying what virtual
		  walking speeds WIP gestures should produce in order to
		  facilitate a natural walking experience.},

  abstract	= "Abstract How do we recognize ourselves as the agents of
		  our actions? Do we use the same error detection mechanisms
		  to monitor self-generated vs. externally imposed actions?
		  Using event-related brain potentials (ERPs), we identified
		  two different error-monitoring loops involved in providing
		  a coherent sense of the agency of our actions. In the first
		  \{ERP\} experiment, the participants were embodied in a
		  virtual body (avatar) while performing an error-prone fast
		  reaction time task. Crucially, in certain trials,
		  participants were deceived regarding their own actions,
		  i.e., the avatar movement did not match the participant's
		  movement. Self-generated real errors and false (avatar)
		  errors showed very different \{ERP\} signatures and with
		  different processing latencies: while real errors showed a
		  classical frontal-central error-related negativity
		  (Ne/ERN), peaking 100 ms after error commission, false
		  errors elicited a larger and delayed parietal negative
		  component (at about 350–400 ms). The violation of the
		  sense of agency elicited by false avatar errors showed a
		  strong similarity to \{ERP\} signatures related to semantic
		  or conceptual violations (N400 component). In a follow-up
		  \{ERP\} control experiment, a subset of the same
		  participants merely acted as observers of the avatar
		  correct and error movements. This experimental situation

		  combined effects of different environmental stressors on
		  behavioral, cognitive, and affective outcomes at the team
		  level. Results from 83 teams working on a command and
		  control simulation indicated that the introduction of a
		  challenge stressor positively affected team performance and
		  transactive memory. The introduction of a hindrance
		  stressor negatively affected team performance and
		  transactive memory and positively affected psychological
		  withdrawal. When the hindrance stressor was combined with
		  the challenge stressor, teams exhibited the lowest levels
		  of performance and transactive memory, and the highest
		  levels of psychological withdrawal. These effects were due
		  to the adoption of specific coping strategies by team
		  members. Implications are discussed, as well as limitations

		  Children (10- and 12-year-olds) and adults rode a bicycle
		  through a virtual environment with 12 intersections.
		  Participants faced continuous cross traffic and waited for
		  gaps they judged were adequate for crossing. In the control
		  condition, participants encountered randomly ordered gaps
		  ranging from 1.5 to 5.0 s at all intersections. In the
		  high-density condition, participants encountered
		  high-density intersections sandwiched between sets of
		  control intersections. These high-density intersections
		  were designed to push participants toward taking tighter
		  gaps. Participants in both conditions were more likely to
		  accept 3.5-, 4.0-, 4.5-, and 5.0-s gaps at the last set of
		  intersections than at the first set of intersections,
		  whereas participants in the high-density condition were
		  also more likely to accept very tight 3.0-s gaps at the
		  last intersections than at the first intersections.
		  Moreover, individuals in the high-density condition who
		  waited less and took shorter gaps at the middle
		  intersections were also more likely to take very tight
		  3.0-s gaps at the last intersections. The 10-year-olds in
		  both conditions had more time to spare when they cleared
		  the path of the oncoming car at the last intersections,
		  whereas the 12-year-olds and adults showed no change in
		  time to spare across intersections. The discussion focuses
		  on linking short-term change in perceptual-motor

		  system is learning how to move the self in relation to
		  other moving objects. This often involves perceiving and
		  acting on affordances or possibilities for action that
		  depend on the relation between the characteristics of the
		  individual and the properties of the environment (Gibson,
		  1979). This chapter overviews our program of research on
		  perceiving and acting on dynamic affordances (i.e.,
		  possibilities for action that vary over time). Our goal is
		  to bridge the divide between basic and applied research by
		  using road crossing as a model system for studying how
		  children's ability to perceive and act on dynamic
		  affordances undergoes change with age and experience. The
		  basic task is for participants to cross virtual roads with
		  continuous traffic either on foot or on a bicycle. This
		  work reveals that children's gap choices and crossing
		  motions are less tightly linked than those of adults.
		  Children often choose the same size gaps as adults but time
		  their entry into those gaps less tightly than adults. As a
		  result, children typically end up with less time to spare
		  than adults when they clear the path of the vehicles.
		  Improvement in gap selection and movement timing occurs
		  gradually over development, indicating the
		  perception‚Äìaction system undergoes continuous change
		  well into adolescence. As in other areas of development
		  (e.g., face perception, word recognition), this kind of
		  gradual developmental change appears critical for the
		  fine-tuning of the system. The late development of these
		  skills may explain also why adolescent pedestrians,
		  cyclists, and drivers continue to be at risk for collisions
		  when crossing roads. Further work aimed at better
		  understanding the developmental mechanisms underlying these
		  changes will inform the fields of both developmental
		  science and injury prevention."

  abstract	= {Virtual reality training systems are commonly used in a

		  the realism of a training simulation influences training
		  effectiveness. We conducted a controlled experiment to test
		  the effects of display and scenario properties on training
		  effectiveness for a visual scanning task in a simulated
		  urban environment. The experiment varied the levels of
		  field of view and visual complexity during a training phase
		  and then evaluated scanning performance with the
		  simulator's highest levels of fidelity and scene
		  complexity. To assess scanning performance, we measured
		  target detection and adherence to a prescribed strategy.
		  The results show that both field of view and visual
		  complexity significantly affected target detection during
		  training; higher field of view led to better performance
		  and higher visual complexity worsened performance.
		  Additionally, adherence to the prescribed visual scanning
		  strategy during assessment was best when the level of
		  visual complexity during training matched that of the
		  assessment conditions, providing evidence that similar
		  visual complexity was important for learning the technique.
		  The results also demonstrate that task performance during
		  training was not always a sufficient measure of mastery of
		  an instructed technique. That is, if learning a prescribed
		  strategy or skill is the goal of a training exercise,
		  performance in a simulation may not be an appropriate
		  indicator of effectiveness outside of training-evaluation
		  in a more realistic setting may be necessary.},

		  All participants learned the correct route through a maze,

		  maze. The results revealed equivalent age effects for these
		  tasks in the real and the virtual world. In both conditions
		  younger children needed more trials to learn the route and

		  did not differ in either the virtual or the real world

		  innovative tool for health-related education and training.
		  Among the many benefits of virtual reality is the
		  opportunity for novice users to engage unsupervised in a
		  safe environment when the real environment might be
		  dangerous. Virtual environments are only useful for
		  health-related research, however, if behavior in the
		  virtual world validly matches behavior in the real world.
		  This study was designed to test the validity of an
		  immersive, interactive virtual pedestrian environment. A
		  sample of 102 children and 74 adults was recruited to
		  complete simulated road-crossings in both the virtual
		  environment and the identical real environment. In both the
		  child and adult samples, construct validity was
		  demonstrated via significant correlations between behavior
		  in the virtual and real worlds. Results also indicate
		  construct validity through developmental differences in
		  behavior; convergent validity by showing correlations
		  between parent-reported child temperament and behavior in
		  the virtual world; internal reliability of various measures
		  of pedestrian safety in the virtual world; and face
		  validity, as measured by users’ self-reported perception
		  of realism in the virtual world. We discuss issues of
		  generalizability to other virtual environments, and the
		  implications for application of virtual reality to
		  understanding and preventing pediatric pedestrian injuries.

		  participants tend to respond realistically to situations
		  and events portrayed within an immersive virtual reality
		  system. The idea is put forward, based on the experience of
		  a large number of experimental studies, that there are two
		  orthogonal components that contribute to this realistic
		  response. The first is {\textquoteleft}being
		  there{\textquoteright}, often called
		  {\textquoteleft}presence{\textquoteright}, the qualia of
		  having a sensation of being in a real place. We call this
		  place illusion (PI). Second, plausibility illusion (Psi)
		  refers to the illusion that the scenario being depicted is
		  actually occurring. In the case of both PI and Psi the
		  participant knows for sure that they are not
		  {\textquoteleft}there{\textquoteright} and that the events
		  are not occurring. PI is constrained by the sensorimotor
		  contingencies afforded by the virtual reality system. Psi
		  is determined by the extent to which the system can produce
		  events that directly relate to the participant, the overall
		  credibility of the scenario being depicted in comparison
		  with expectations. We argue that when both PI and Psi
		  occur, participants will respond realistically to the
		  virtual reality. {\textcopyright} 2009 The Royal Society},

  abstract	= {<sec> <title>Background</title> <p>Altering the normal
		  association between touch and its visual correlate can
		  result in the illusory perception of a fake limb as part of
		  our own body. Thus, when touch is seen to be applied to a
		  rubber hand while felt synchronously on the corresponding
		  hidden real hand, an illusion of ownership of the rubber
		  hand usually occurs. The illusion has also been
		  demonstrated using visuomotor correlation between the
		  movements of the hidden real hand and the seen fake hand.
		  This type of paradigm has been used with respect to the
		  whole body generating out-of-the-body and body substitution
		  illusions. However, such studies have only ever manipulated
		  a single factor and although they used a form of virtual
		  reality have not exploited the power of immersive virtual
		  reality (IVR) to produce radical transformations in body
		  ownership.</p> </sec><sec> <title>Principal
		  Findings</title> <p>Here we show that a first person
		  perspective of a life-sized virtual human female body that
		  appears to substitute the male subjects' own bodies was
		  sufficient to generate a body transfer illusion. This was
		  demonstrated subjectively by questionnaire and
		  physiologically through heart-rate deceleration in response
		  to a threat to the virtual body. This finding is in
		  contrast to earlier experimental studies that assume
		  visuotactile synchrony to be the critical contributory
		  factor in ownership illusions. Our finding was possible
		  because IVR allowed us to use a novel experimental design
		  for this type of problem with three independent binary
		  factors: (i) perspective position (first or third), (ii)
		  synchronous or asynchronous mirror reflections and (iii)
		  synchrony or asynchrony between felt and seen touch.</p>
		  </sec><sec> <title>Conclusions</title> <p>The results
		  support the notion that bottom-up perceptual mechanisms can
		  temporarily override top down knowledge resulting in a
		  radical illusion of transfer of body ownership. The
		  research also illustrates immersive virtual reality as a
		  powerful tool in the study of body representation and
		  experience, since it supports experimental manipulations
		  that would otherwise be infeasible, with the technology
		  being mature enough to represent human bodies and their
		  motion.</p> </sec>},

		  tracking is impaired by walking from one location to
		  another, suggesting that updating location of the self puts
		  demands on object tracking processes. Here, we quantified
		  the cost of self-motion in terms of the tracking load.
		  Participants in a virtual environment tracked a variable
		  number of targets (1-5) among distractors while either
		  staying in one place or moving along a path that was
		  similar to the objects motion. At the end of each trial,
		  participants decided whether a probed dot was a target or
		  distractor. As in our previous work, self-motion
		  significantly impaired performance in tracking multiple
		  targets. Quantifying tracking capacity for each individual
		  under move versus stay conditions further revealed that
		  self-motion during tracking produced a cost to capacity of
		  about 0.8 (±0.2) objects. Tracking your own motion is
		  worth about one object, suggesting that updating the
		  location of the self is similar, but perhaps slightly
		  easier, than updating locations of objects.}

  abstract	= { <p>A classical question in philosophy and psychology is
		  if the sense of one's body influences how one visually
		  perceives the world. Several theoreticians have suggested
		  that our own body serves as a fundamental reference in
		  visual perception of sizes and distances, although
		  compelling experimental evidence for this hypothesis is
		  lacking. In contrast, modern textbooks typically explain
		  the perception of object size and distance by the
		  combination of information from different visual cues.
		  Here, we describe full body illusions in which subjects
		  experience the ownership of a doll's body (80 cm or 30 cm)
		  and a giant's body (400 cm) and use these as tools to
		  demonstrate that the size of one's sensed own body directly
		  influences the perception of object size and distance.
		  These effects were quantified in ten separate experiments
		  with complementary verbal, questionnaire, manual, walking,
		  and physiological measures. When participants experienced
		  the tiny body as their own, they perceived objects to be
		  larger and farther away, and when they experienced the
		  large-body illusion, they perceived objects to be smaller
		  and nearer. Importantly, despite identical retinal input,
		  this “body size effect” was greater when the
		  participants experienced a sense of ownership of the
		  artificial bodies compared to a control condition in which
		  ownership was disrupted. These findings are fundamentally
		  important as they suggest a causal relationship between the
		  representations of body space and external space. Thus, our
		  own body size affects how we perceive the world.</p> },

  abstract	= "Abstract Visual information uptake is a fundamental
		  element of sports involving interceptive tasks. Several
		  methodologies, like video and methods based on virtual
		  environments, are currently employed to analyze visual
		  perception during sport situations. Both techniques have
		  advantages and drawbacks. The goal of this study is to
		  determine which of these technologies may be preferentially
		  used to analyze visual information uptake during a sport
		  situation. To this aim, we compared a handball
		  goalkeeper’s performance using two standardized
		  methodologies: video clip and virtual environment. We
		  examined this performance for two response tasks: an
		  uncoupled task (goalkeepers show where the ball ends) and a
		  coupled task (goalkeepers try to intercept the virtual
		  ball). Variables investigated in this study were percentage
		  of correct zones, percentage of correct responses, radial
		  error and response time. The results showed that handball
		  goalkeepers were more effective, more accurate and started
		  to intercept earlier when facing a virtual handball thrower
		  than when facing the video clip. These findings suggested
		  that the analysis of visual information uptake for handball
		  goalkeepers was better performed by using a ‘virtual
		  reality’-based methodology. Technical and methodological
		  aspects of these findings are discussed further. "

		  for virtual environment systems are interfaces that are
		  driven by the user's actual stepping motions and do not
		  include treadmills or other mechanical devices. While both
		  walking-in-place and real-walking interfaces compute the
		  user's speed and direction and convert those values into
		  viewpoint movement between frames, they differ in how they
		  enable the user to move to any distant location in very
		  large virtual scenes. Walking-in-place constrains the
		  user's actual movement to a small area and translates
		  stepping-in-place motions into viewpoint movement.
		  Real-walking applies one of several techniques to transform
		  the virtual scene so that the user's physical path stays
		  within the available laboratory space. This chapter
		  discusses implementations of these two types of interfaces
		  with particular regard to how walking-in-place interfaces
		  generate smooth motion and how real-walking interfaces
		  modify the user's view of the scene so deviations from her
		  real motion are less detectable.",
